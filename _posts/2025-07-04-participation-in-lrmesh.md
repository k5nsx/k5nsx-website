We have been working with others in the area to expand the coverage of the mesh network in central Arkansas and would like to invite you to participate.

Here is a description of [LRMesh](https://lrme.sh), be sure to visit the [website](https://lrme.sh) for more information.

LR Mesh is a community of individuals working to build a network of Meshtastic radios in the Central Arkansas area. This network acts like an area-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. The mesh network can also be used to transmit GPS locations or read weather and other telemetry. All of this happens without any external infrastructure – no cell phone towers, no internet. We are growing every day.
