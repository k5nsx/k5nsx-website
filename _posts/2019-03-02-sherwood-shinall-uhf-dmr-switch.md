The Shinall K5NSX and Sherwood AC5XV UHF DMR repeaters have been switched. This switch might be temporary or it might be permanent…that is yet to be determined. For now, we are testing to see if there are issues with the hardware on the K5NSX repeater. If you notice differences in coverage between now and before the switch, please let us know.

The repeaters page has been updated to reflect the change.
