We used to maintain basic starter codeplugs for the K5NSX repeaters. With so many DMR radios now on the market, I (AE5AU) don't have time to maintain them (nor do I have many of the new/popular rigs).  Here are some [codeplugs from Mason, AF5WN](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1TfJV5yvWn_jZisJxeNT3HG9XNb_9DqkV) that might be a decent starting place.  If anyone wants to maintain a cloud share with codeplugs for central Arkansas, I would be happy to link to it.
