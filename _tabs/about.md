The purpose of the Natural State Xperimenters is to promote friendship, knowledge and experimentation with radio technologies and to assist other organizations, regardless of affiliation, do the same.

We are a loose, informal group without official membership or dues. Many of us own and/or maintain repeater systems. Others are just interested in experimenting with new facets of the amateur radio hobby.
